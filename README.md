hello, i go by Colin, or Colin Sane wherever a form requires a surname.
don't confuse me with @colinsane, who claimed a handle on this website and then proceeded to never do anything with it. hmm.

my home is at [uninsane.org](https://uninsane.org/about).
my preferred contact method is via Matrix `@colin:uninsane.org` or email `colin@uninsane.org`,
XMPP if you're old-school `colin@uninsane.org`,
or activity pub for shorter form stuff: [@colin@fed.uninsane.org](fed.uninsane.org/colin).

my code lives at [git.uninsane.org](https://git.uninsane.org): what you see on my Microsoft GitHub profile here
are mirrors of a subset of repos from there because a handful of FOSS projects i contribute
to host on MS GitHub.

to projects considering a move away from MS GitHub, i say: please do!
host your project under the [freedesktop.org](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/NewProject/) or [GNOME](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME) umbrella,
or go for the classic `git send-email` workflow over at [Sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/).
i have and will continue to contribute to your project even as you host it elsewhere.
i may well be _more_ eager to contribute, because core to FOSS as an ideology is 
distributing power away from the center and putting more of it in the hand
of the user-contributor. git was _made_ to be distributed.
